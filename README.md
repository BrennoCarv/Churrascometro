> I made this project to calculate the amount of food needed for a barbecue, in order to save due to user demand.

### The user places the number of people and children, filling in the fields:

+ Number of adults, who will consume alcoholic beverages and meat and pepperoni.
+ Quantities of children who will consume soft drinks, meat and pepperoni.
+ Finally, the user will put the estimated duration (time) of the barbecue.

> Technology used:
+ JAVASCRIPT
+ HTML5
+ CSS3

Don't forget to see the images.
